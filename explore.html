              <h3>Seoul - Hanok Village</h3>
              <span>by Sophie Kim</span>
              <p>
                Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village in Seoul with a long history located on the top of a hill between Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace and Jongmyo Royal Shrine. The traditional village is composed of many alleys, hanok and is preserved to show a 600-year-old urban environment.
                A poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors, conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, stated that exploring the narrow streets of Bukchon was their fourth favorite activity in Seoul.
According to data by the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center, 30,000 people visited the area in 2007. However, after the village was featured in television programmes, such as 1 Night 2 Days and Personal Taste, the number rose to 318,000 in 2010. In 2012 the figure is expected to double to more than 600,000.
A large beautiful hanok has open to the public in 2015, as part of the Seoul Museum of History. It is located in an alley, just on the foot of the hill. Entrance is free, the visit allows to see those traditional housing in 15–20 minutes.
